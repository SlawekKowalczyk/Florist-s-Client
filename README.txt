# Florist-s-Client
The florist's is a client-server application. Below you may find a customer description.
The shop serves the needs of both - individual and business customers.
The customer has the possibility to choose flowers with decorations and add them to the shop cart. 
Then after paying, an individual customer gets a receipt but the bussiness customer may receive an invoice. 
A lot of customers can be handled at the same time.

All articles and prices are stored on a server in a database. We connect it via JDBC using the Internet connection and a socket. 
The server can be run on a separate device.
